        <h3>More about me</h3>
        <p>I live in <em>Mahwah</em>, but I grew up in <b>Rutherford</b>. I love to read, do art, play lacrosse, and hang out with my friends. I like to spend time with my family and my dog daisy. I love food, eating, and all types of cuisine.  </p>
        <p>I have an older sister and so many cousins, we always hang out together and bake, watch movies, go on drives or cook dinner for the family. I love all holidays but Thanksgiving is one of my favorites! (I love mashed potatoes.)</p>
        <p>Some of my current shows I'm watching is The Glory on Netflix and I'm rewatching the Flash. My current reads are Book Lovers by Emily Henry and The Final Gambit by Jennifer Lynn Barnes</p>
