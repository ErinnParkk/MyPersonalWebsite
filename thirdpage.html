        <h1><strong>Hobbies!</strong></h1>
        <h2 class="bold">Lacrosse</h2>
        <p>Currently, one of the activites that I do that is taking up all of my time right now is <b>lacrosse!</b> My friends and I all play lacrosse together and I've met so many cool people because of lacrosse. I play defense and I definitely still have more to work on! I'm so sad that so many of the seniors are going to be leaving the team, but that doesn't mean I won't be visiting them where ever they end up going!</p>
        <h2 class="bold">TVAC</h2>
        <p>TVAC is the teaneck volunteer ambulance corps! I volunteer there every saturday and I am going to emt school this summer actually! I'm really excited for EMT school and can't wait to hopefully become a certified emt by the end of the year so that I can start to be more involved on calls at TVAC. </p>
        <h2 class="bold">HOSA</h2>
        <p>Another upcoming event is HOSA nationals in Dallas! My group had placed 3rd in state and we are now currently prepping for nationals in June. While I won't be able to go to CEE like most of the other juniors, I'm hoping that my group might place at nationals or at least have fun while in Dallas! </p>
        <h2 class="bold">Traveling</h2>
        <p>I love to travel and see new places! My family usually tries to go somewhere during the summer in order to relax and also sightsee, but I unfortunately won't be going anywhere this summer. One of my favorite places I have visited is Korea because my grandma and cousins live there and the food is always so good! </p>
